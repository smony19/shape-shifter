 * This is intended to be a challenge for any squad who gets finished with everything else.
 * If you haven't done the other challenges, try those first!
 * 
 * Imagine you have two rectangles with horizontal bases. If you draw them on the same grid,
 * they would overlap! Each rectangle is described by an array of coordinates, for example:
 * [{ x: 0, y: 0 }, { x: 1, y: 0 }, { x: 1, y: 1 }, { x: 0, y: 1 }]
 * Can you write a function which calculates the area of the overlap between two rectangles?
 *

 * @param {{x: number, y: number}[]} rectangle1 - The four corners of rectangle 1
